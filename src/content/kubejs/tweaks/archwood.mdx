## Remove Wild Archwood Trees

<span class="badge text-bg-dark startup-scripts">startup_scripts</span>

This prevents Archwood Trees from spawning anywhere outside of Archwood Forests.

```js
WorldgenEvents.remove((event) => {
  event.removeFeatureById(/ars_nouveau:archwood_forest/, "vegetal_decoration", [
    "ars_nouveau:placed_mixed_archwoods",
    "ars_elemental:flashing_archwood",
  ]);
});
```
