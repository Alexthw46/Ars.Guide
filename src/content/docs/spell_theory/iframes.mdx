An "I-Frame" (short for invulnerability frame) refers to a short window during which an entity becomes invulnerable after being hit.

The default duration of an I-Frame is 11 ticks, which is approximately 0.55 seconds, except for certain effects such as poison that at higher level start to attack every tick.

## How do I-Frames impact designing spells?

If an entity is hit with multiple damage sources at the exact same tick, then only the source with the highest damage will apply.

In the following spell <Glyphs glyphs={["touch", "harm", "amplify", "harm", "harm"]} />, only the damage from the <Glyphs glyphs={["harm", "amplify"]} /> will apply, and the other two harm glyphs will be wasted.

## How can I bypass I-Frames?

In Ars Nouveau it's not possible to bypass I-Frames without an addon or another mod that allows the behaviour.

Here are some methods that allow bypassing I-Frames depending on your mod list:

### Ars Elemental

Ars Elemental is an incredibly popular Ars addon that adds a lot of new glyphs and effects themed around the elements.

#### Hellfire

Ars Elemental adds a new effect called Hellfire, this effect allows creatures that are immune to fire damage to be damaged by Fire Spells, but it also causes <Glyphs glyphs={["heal"]} /> to reset the damage immunity for the damaged entity.

Using this effect alongside a glyph like <Glyphs glyphs={["hex"]} /> allows you to half the healing they receive and add more damage on top.

Hellfire can be applied in two ways, using a Fire Focus, or a Tier 3 Kindling thread. Once you have one of these equipped you'll need to cast <Glyphs glyphs={["ignite"]} /> to apply Hellfire to your target.

#### Frozen

Ars Elemental adds another new effect called Frozen, this effect allows the glyph <Glyphs glyphs={["freeze"]} /> to reset the entities immunity frames.

This happens once an entity is hit by Freeze and becomes fully frozen, which can be achieved faster using <Glyphs glyphs={["amplify"]} />.

### Ars Trinkets

Ars Trinkets is a power fantasy addon that allows you to reach unprecedented levels of mana and spell power.

#### Air Sword

For the low cost of 3000 mana, you can cast <Glyphs glyphs={["air_sword"]} /> which will reset the invulnerability frames of any entity hit after the <Glyphs glyphs={["air_sword"]} /> deals damage.

### Other ways to bypass I&#8209;Frames

Certain mods allow players to bypass I-Frames in different ways.

#### Iron's RPG Tweaks
[Iron's RPG Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irons-rpg-tweaks) removes the concept of invulnerability frames entirely.
