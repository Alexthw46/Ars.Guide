The Alchemical Sourcelink generates source from consuming nearby potion jars.

| Max Source | Transfer Rate | Event Range (Blocks) |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 20000      | 10000         | 1                    |

## Source Per Potion

Potions are consumed per 100mb

Each effect in the potion jar is evaluated as:  
`(duration / 50) + (amplifier * 250) + 150`[^1]

The source produced by the potion is evaluated as:  
`75 + (each effect total)`

If the potion has multiple effects, then an additional modifier is applied:  
`total * (2.1 ^ effects)`

[^1]: The duration is calculated in ticks
