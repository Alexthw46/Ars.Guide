This documentation section is for those who need to know the specifics about certain blocks and their implementations.

This can range from the radius of various Sourcelinks to the exact dimensions an Amethyst Golem checks to convert Amethyst blocks to Budding Amethyst.

If a technical topic isn't covered here, feel free to request it in the Discord server linked in the navigation bar.

## What is this not?

This is **not** a substitute for the Ars Nouveau book.

This documentation is not intended to showcase recipes or for general information on how mechanics work.

If you want a way to access the Ars Nouveau book from the web I recommend you head over to the [Official Ars Nouveau Wiki](https://www.arsnouveau.wiki/)
