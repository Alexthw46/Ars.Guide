KubeJS is a mod that creates JavaScript bindings for Minecraft that allow you to manage your server, change recipes and edit functionality.

The mod splits this functionality into <span class="badge text-bg-dark startup-scripts">startup_scripts</span>, <span class="badge text-bg-dark server-scripts">server_scripts</span> and <span class="badge text-bg-dark client-scripts">client_scripts</span>.

- <span class="badge text-bg-dark startup-scripts">startup_scripts</span> manage changes to world generation or registering new items and blocks or integrating directly with Forge events.
- <span class="badge text-bg-dark server-scripts">server_scripts</span> handle both adding and removing recipes, changing tags and modifying loot tables. They can also handle server events like a player right-clicking a block.
- <span class="badge text-bg-dark client-scripts">client_scripts</span> are loaded every time client resources reload, they are used for interacting with clientside mods like JEI or REI and adding tooltips to items.
